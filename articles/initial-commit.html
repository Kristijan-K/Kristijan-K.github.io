		<h1>Initial Thoughts</h1>

			<span class="date">July 11 2025</span>, <span class="read-time">1 min read</span>, <span

		</div>
		<p>This is my personal website, where I will (probably very infrequently) publish articles and
			reflections on various tech topics.</p>
		<p>Most articles today are AI-written and include too
			many empty words to increase the read time. The issue is actually not the length, but the
			content.
			It is
			just painful to read most of them, and I end up skipping to the end trying to find the punchline
			or conclusions.
		</p>
		<p><span>One of my favourite tech articles of all time is </span><a href="https://grugbrain.dev/"
				target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grug brained
				developer</a><span>. It is
				not short, but all the ideas are presented in a funny way, with as few words as
				possible. </span></p>
		<p>I may
			not succeed, but this will be my modus operandi: short reflections on topics that
			interest me,
			without AI-generated fluff or nonsense.</p>
		<p>Why git log</p>
		<p>This statement encompasses what I would like from all my articles (if possible --online version). It
			provides clarity and shows
			important information in a clear and consise way. It also saves me time from coming up a name (I
			can pretend it is a tech thing). The other reason for this is to make it immediately obvious who
			is the main audinece for this... developers and tech people.</p>
