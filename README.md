## How to Publish a New Article

To add a new article to the website, follow these steps:

1.  **Create the Article HTML File**:
    *   Create a new HTML file for your article inside the `articles/` directory (e.g., `articles/my-new-article.html`).
    *   **Template Suggestion**: It's recommended to use an existing article file (e.g., `articles/article-1.html`) as a template to ensure consistent structure, especially for the header and metadata.

2.  **Add Article Entry to `index.html`**:
    *   Open `index.html`.
    *   Locate the `<ul id="articleList">` section within the `<main class="main-content">`.
    *   Add a new `<li>` element for your article, following the existing structure.

    Example `<li>` entry:
    ```html
    <li data-tags="your-tag-1,your-tag-2">
        <a href="articles/your-article-file.html">Your Article Title Here</a>
        <div class="metadata">
            <span class="date">Month Day, Year</span>
            <span class="read-time">X min read</span>
            <span class="tags">#your-tag-1 #your-tag-2</span>
        </div>
    </li>
    ```
    *   **`data-tags` Attribute**: This is crucial for search and tag filtering. Add a `data-tags` attribute to the `<li>` element. Its value should be a comma-separated list of relevant tags (e.g., `data-tags="programming,javascript,webdev"`). These tags will automatically appear in the sidebar and be searchable.
    *   **Article Link**: Ensure the `href` in the `<a>` tag points to your new article's HTML file (e.g., `articles/my-new-article.html`).
    *   **Metadata**: Update the `date`, `read-time`, and `#tags` within the `<div class="metadata">` to reflect your article's details.

## How to Add a New Tag

New tags are automatically recognized by the system. To add a new tag:

1.  Simply include the new tag in the `data-tags` attribute of any article's `<li>` element in `index.html`.
2.  Ensure the tag is also included in the `#tags` span within the article's metadata for display.

The `search.js` script will automatically detect and display new unique tags in the "Tags" sidebar.

## Important CSS Classes (from `index.html` and `search.js` context)

While `style.css` defines the visual appearance, here are some important classes and IDs used in `index.html` and manipulated by `search.js` that are critical for the layout and functionality:

*   `.container`: Main wrapper for the entire page content.
*   `header`: Contains the site navigation.
*   `nav`: Navigation links.
*   `.content-wrapper`: Wraps the sidebar and main content area.
*   `.sidebar`: Container for the tag list.
*   `#tagList`: The `div` where tags are dynamically loaded by `search.js`.
*   `.tag`: Applied to individual tag elements in the sidebar.
*   `.tag.selected`: Applied to a tag when it's actively selected for filtering.
*   `.tag-link`: Applied to tag links generated by `populateTagList` function in `search.js`.
*   `.main-content`: Main area for the article list and search box.
*   `#searchBox`: The input field for searching articles.
*   `#articleList`: The `ul` element containing all article `<li>` entries.
*   `.metadata`: Container for article date, read time, and tags.
*   `.date`: Span for the article publication date.
*   `.read-time`: Span for the estimated reading time.
*   `.tags`: Span for displaying article tags (e.g., `#networking #tcpip`).

## Search and Tag Filtering Functionality

*   **Search on Main Page**: The search functionality on the main page (`index.html`) works by filtering articles based on the text entered in the `#searchBox`. It searches both the article title (from the `<a>` tag) and the `data-tags` attribute of each `<li>` element.
*   **Tag Links from Article to Main**: When you click on a tag in the sidebar on `index.html`, or if an article links back to `index.html` with a `?tag=your-tag` query parameter (e.g., `index.html?tag=networking`), the `search.js` script will automatically filter the articles on the main page to show only those associated with that specific tag.
*   **Tag Filtering on Main Page**:
    *   The `search.js` script dynamically generates the tag list in the sidebar from the `data-tags` attributes of all articles.
    *   Clicking a tag in the sidebar toggles its selection. Multiple tags can be selected to narrow down the results (articles must match *any* of the selected tags).
    *   The `renderArticles()` function in `search.js` applies both the search box filter and the selected tag filters to display relevant articles.
